Andreas,

Thank you for writing.  You are welcome to distribute the Cephes material
posted to the net under a BSD license.

I don't think I know what cephes.doc is.  The distribution -- either from
netlib.org or moshier.net --  comes with html files that have names like
doubldoc.html for the double precision functions.  There could be some
functions not documented, but that's unintentional.
